# PRJ_HAL_Driver - Project-Specific HAL Drivers

This directory contains STM32 HAL driver files that are required by the project but are **not** generated by STM32CubeMX during `.ioc` regeneration.

## Purpose

When peripherals (like DAC, UART) are manually initialized in `solution_hal_cfg.c` instead of being enabled in CubeMX, the corresponding HAL driver files are not included in the generated project. However, the type definitions (e.g., `DAC_HandleTypeDef`, `UART_HandleTypeDef`) are still needed.

This directory stores those additional HAL driver files independently from the CubeMX-managed `STM32G4xx_HAL_Driver` directory, ensuring they are not deleted during CubeMX regeneration.

## Contents

### DAC Driver
- `Inc/stm32g4xx_hal_dac.h` - DAC HAL header
- `Inc/stm32g4xx_hal_dac_ex.h` - DAC extended HAL header
- `Src/stm32g4xx_hal_dac.c` - DAC HAL source
- `Src/stm32g4xx_hal_dac_ex.c` - DAC extended HAL source

### UART Driver
- `Inc/stm32g4xx_hal_uart.h` - UART HAL header
- `Inc/stm32g4xx_hal_uart_ex.h` - UART extended HAL header
- `Src/stm32g4xx_hal_uart.c` - UART HAL source
- `Src/stm32g4xx_hal_uart_ex.c` - UART extended HAL source

## Configuration

To enable these drivers:
1. Enable module in `Core/Inc/stm32g4xx_hal_conf.h`:
   ```c
   #define HAL_DAC_MODULE_ENABLED
   #define HAL_UART_MODULE_ENABLED
   ```

2. Include path is added in `cmake/stm32cubemx/CMakeLists.txt`:
   ```cmake
   ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../Drivers/PRJ_HAL_Driver/Inc
   ```

3. Source files are compiled via CMakeLists.txt

## Source

These files are copied from the complete STM32G4xx HAL library (available in STM32CubeMX or STM32Cube_FW_G4 package).
